Feature: Calendar
  In order to be able to access the calendar
  As an authenticated user
  We need to be able to add and view events in the calendar.

#  @javascript
#  Scenario: Show the calendar.
#    Given I login with user "admin"
#    When  I open the calendar
#    Then  I should see "Hide Calendar"
